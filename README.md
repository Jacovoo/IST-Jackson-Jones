This is a website made for school by Jackson Jones.

To use, clone the repository and open index.html to go to the home page.

Mostly everything was written by me. The only things i do not own are some of the sign up page, the code for cutting the corners on the descriptions in the store page (https://css-generators.com/custom-corners/), and specifically the javascript code for store buttons. All assets are also handmade, except for photos like the ships. The logo, background, footer image and header image are all done by me.

This is a website made for school by Jackson Jones.

To use, clone the repository and open index.html to go to the home page.

Mostly everything was written by me. The only things i do not own are some of the sign up page, the code for cutting the corners on the descriptions in the store page (https://css-generators.com/custom-corners/), and specifically the javascript code for store buttons.
